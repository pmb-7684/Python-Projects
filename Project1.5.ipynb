You and the girls may go, or you may send\\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\\nparty.\"\\n\\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\\nI do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has\\nfive grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own\\nbeauty.\"\\n\\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\\n\\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\\nthe neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\\n\\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\\nmerely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new\\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\\nhim, if you do not.\"\\n\\n\"You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\\nhearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though\\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\\n\\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\\ngood humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the\\npreference.\"\\n\\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\\nquickness than her sisters.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.\"\\n\\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\\nthese twenty years at least.\"\\n\\n\"Ah! you do not know what I suffer.\"\\n\\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\\n\\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not\\nvisit them.\"\\n\\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\\nall.\"\\n\\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had\\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she\\nfancied herself nervous.
